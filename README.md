# 🧠 Para ad cogitandum
**(A Gymnasium for Critical Thinking)**

**Train your mind in the age of Artificial Intelligence.**

### Our Mission
Welcome to *Para ad cogitandum*. This is not just a collection of *prompts*. It is a **mental gymnasium**.

Our mission is to use Artificial Intelligence as a Socratic *sparring partner* to sharpen the most important tool you possess: your ability to think.

These *prompts* have been designed with a method that combines pedagogy, philosophy, dialectics, and rhetoric to attack "mental laziness" and build robust logic. They are free, open-source, and yours to use.

## 🏋️‍♂️ YOUR TRAINING (Minimum Viable Product)

Our curriculum begins here. We are launching with 3 foundational *prompts* that demonstrate our full pedagogical vision, from primary school to university.

### MODULE 1: The Logical Tutor (The Pillar)
* **Level:** High School / University
* **Description:** Pure strength training. Learn to deconstruct texts and separate the argument from the noise.

> **WARNING BEFORE YOU START!**
> This *prompt* is a **relentless Socratic Tutor**.
> * It will NOT give you the answer. Ever.
> * It will ONLY ask you questions.
> * It WILL be frustrating. It is designed to be.
> Accept the challenge. The reward is real.


### MODULE 2: The Story Detective (The Vision)
* **Level:** Primary School (Ages 6-9)
* **Description:** Proof that logic begins with play. Perfect for parents and educators.
* **Mission:** Discover the "spark" (cause) and the "superpower" (moral) hidden in any story.



### MODULE 3: The Debate Arena (The Community)
* **Level:** Middle School / High School
* **Description:** The fast-paced dojo for your fallacy detector.
* **Mission:** Challenge our AI "Polemicist," spot their logical traps, and train your mental agility in an addictive game format.


## 🏆 Have you beaten the AI? Now for the Next Level.

The AI is your *sparring partner*. The real debate is the *championship*.

These *prompts* are the warm-up. The real work is done in a community.

As the founder of this project, I lead **live weekly debates** and offer **personalized coaching** where we test these skills against human opponents and real-world problems.


### A Living Repository
This is the beginning. Our goal is to build the full 40-prompt curriculum. This repository will be updated frequently.
